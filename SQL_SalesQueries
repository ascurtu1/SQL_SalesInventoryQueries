In the following SQL queries, I am extracting information from a large SQLite database that contains multiple tables of customer and sales data. 

# How many orders were placed in January?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6;


# How many of those orders were for an iPhone?

SELECT COUNT(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID) = 6
AND Product = "iPhone";


# Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.

SELECT distinct customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.customers
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales
ON FebSales.orderID = customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderID) = 6;
